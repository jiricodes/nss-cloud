Similary [PostgreSQL's liberal licence](Postgresql) is compatible with GNU AGPLv3. However in both cases the licenses are not compatible in the opposite direction (GNU AGPLv3 cannot be a module of MIT or Apache License v2 based projects) and therefore this project needs to be licensed under the same GNU AGPLv3, as stated in the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file.
